### Exploratory Data Analysis on the bus route of Kingston, ON, CA 
We start by analyzing the ‘Transit Data – October’ data collectively to obtain a general understanding about the transit data and how to address the provided 4 questions. Through some simple data cleaning and pre-processing of the ‘Transit Data – October’ data, each team member uses Python or other visualization tools to generate figures related to their assigned questions. Moreover, to further support the answers we arrived, we have researched and analyzed other datasets that contain more geographic information about the bus routes and Kingston resident addresses. Then, by using the Google Map API and Geopandas Python package, we manage to visualize those geographical data interactively.
