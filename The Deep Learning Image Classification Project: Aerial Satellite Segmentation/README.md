# The Deep Learning Image Classification Project: Aerial Satellite Segmentation

Nowadays, drones play an important role in our lives. It can not only be used to take photographs or shoot videos, but also can be used for military, search and rescue. And one of the main technologies of drones is Aerial Semantic Segmentation. It helps drones to do object classification, object detection and segmentation. Moreover, Aerial Semantic Segmentation is also widely used in many critical applications, such as autonomous cars, which is the most popular applications in recent years. Thus, we are interested in this topic and want to know more about it.

In this project, we will attempt to identify which model is more suitable for the Aerial Semantic Segmentation task. The 4 models in consideration are Simple CNN model, FCN8s+VGG-19, DeepLabV3+ with ResNet101, and the U-Net model.
